#Open Source Journal Publishing Guidelines

Follow the structure of this document to write a good article for the OSJ. The preferred format for the OSJ submissions os *Open Document* or *markdown*, whichever you prefer.

The format of the Open Document should follow the markdown formatting:

* Heading 1-5
* Normal paragraph text
* Inline ``code``, block code
* Numbered & unnumbered lists
* Images
* Tables

These formats translate directly to the markdown syntax. If you are using Open Document, do not use any advanced formatting.

For example, head over to
[sample.md](https://github.com/eigengo/opensourcejournal/blob/master/sample.md);
or for a full article from an older issue of OSJ, head over to
[cake.md](https://github.com/eigengo/opensourcejournal/blob/master/cake-pattern/cake.md).

The markdown/GibHub approach lends itself very easily to adding source code to your article. Feel free to follow the outline here.

#Submitting your articles
Send pull requests to the branch corresponding to the issue you would
like to publish your article in (currently ``2013.1`` for October
2013). We will review your PR and merge it if it matches our publishing
guidelines, the audience of the journal and if the code _builds
automatically and passes all tests_.
