#Foreword

This is the first issue of the journal where we used Git pull requests to manage the editorial process. I was very pleased to see that the pull request approach was completely natural to the authors and reviewers. This says a lot about how natural contributions to various open source projects have become, and shows that there really is no excuse to just stand by while the whole world hacks away. 

It takes a bit more courage to make a contribution that the whole world can see and review rater than sending an e-mail to an "articles at" address. However, this openness encourages good & friendly communication, especially towards the newbies. Remember that we are all newbies, and that few things are more discouraging that being told that 

With that, I would like to thank our contributors for their brilliant articles; and our reviewers, especially Chris Cundill, for all the hard work that made this issue of OSJ possible. If you would like to work with us to make a new dent in the universe, send a PR to the ``2014.1`` branch of the OSJ at https://github.com/eigengo/opensourcejournal.
